## Leonhard Euler

I have started translation of Leonhard Euler's magnificent
<em>Introduction to Analysis of the Infinite</em> from the original
Latin.

<div class="eulerdocs"></div>
* Chapter 18: [Continued Fractions][e101-ch18-en]. Translation complete.  And [original][e101-ch18].

I have previously translated into English the following works of Euler
which he originally wrote in French:

<div class="eulerdocs"></div>
* e170 [<cite>Investigations on the imaginary roots of equations.</cite>][e170] Plus a translator's [introduction][e170intro].
* e175 [<cite>Discovery of a most extraordinary law of numbers, relating to the sum of their divisors.</cite>][e175]
* e309 [<cite>A solution to a curious problem which seems not subjected to any analysis.</cite>][e309]
* e310 [<cite>A new method for eliminating unknown quantities from equations.</cite>][e310]
* e334 [<cite>General investigations on the mortality and the multiplication of man.</cite>][e334]
* e335 [<cite>On life annuities.</cite>][e335]
* e461 [<cite>Extract of a letter from Mr. Euler to Mr. Bernoulli.</cite>][e461]

I have also processed and uploaded to archive.org well over a hundred scans
of [original][euler-orig] 18th-century articles published by Euler.  These are
all in French and written while he was at the Berlin Academy.

While I was at it, I processed and uploaded the [journals][berlin] that these articles appeared in too.
