## Catullus

Here are some poems written by Catullus, along with my
translations of them into English.

| [Catullus 3][cat3]   | | | *A passerine passes. (Or bye-bye birdie.)*                  |
| [Catullus 5][cat5]   | | | *Love, mortality, kisses, jealousy, and maybe an abacus.*   |
| [Catullus 7][cat7]   | | | *More kisses, by Jove.*                                     |
| [Catullus 13][cat13] | | | *A dinner invitation scent.*                                |
| [Catullus 15][cat15] | | | *A strange dish of fish &amp; veggies. Explicit.*           |
| [Catullus 16][cat16] | | | *Dissing the reviewers. Explicit.*                          |
| [Catullus 27][cat27] | | | *Brandy, you're a fine girl.*                               |
| [Catullus 33][cat33] | | | *Partners in crime and a missing bath towel? Explicit.*     |
| [Catullus 85][cat85] | | | *Frame thy fearful symmetry.*                               |


My goals are fidelity and natural English idiom, which are goals in tension,
and that makes translation fun and challenging.
