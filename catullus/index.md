## Catullus

Here are some poems written by Catullus that I have translated.
Each one includes both the original Latin and my translation into English.

I aim for fidelity to the meaning, tone, and structure, and try not to
create awkwardness where there wasn't any, but I do not
try to edit the original, nor explicate while
translating, nor do I reproduce the meter.

| [Catullus 3][cat3]   | | A passerine passes. (Or bye-bye birdie.)                  |
| [Catullus 5][cat5]   | | Love, mortality, kisses, jealousy, and maybe an abacus.   |
| [Catullus 7][cat7]   | | More kisses, by Jove.                                     |
| [Catullus 13][cat13] | | A dinner invitation scent.                                |
| [Catullus 15][cat15] | | A strange dish of fish &amp; veggies. Explicit.           |
| [Catullus 16][cat16] | | Dissing the reviewers. Explicit.                          |
| [Catullus 27][cat27] | | Brandy, you're a fine girl.                               |
| [Catullus 33][cat33] | | Partners in crime and a missing bath towel?  Explicit.    |
| [Catullus 85][cat85] | | Frame thy fearful symmetry. |


My goals are [fidelity] and natural English idiom, which are goals in tension,
and that makes translation fun and challenging.
