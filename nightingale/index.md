Ode to the Nightingale
</div>

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 1 </div>

My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
my sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,  
or emptied some dull opiate to the drains  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
one minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk;  
’Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
but being too happy in thine happiness  
that thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in some melodious plot of beechen green,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and shadows numberless,  
singest of summer in full-throated ease.  

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 2 </div>

O, for a draught of vintage that has been  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,  
tasting of flora, and the country green,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
dance and provençal song, and sunburnt mirth.  
O, for a beaker full of the warm south,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
full of the true and blissful Hippocrene  
with cluster’d bubbles winking at the brim  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
and purple-stained mouth,  
that I might drink and leave the world unseen  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
and with thee fade away into the forest dim.  

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 3 </div>

Fade far away, dissolve and quite forget  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
what thou among the leaves hast never known,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the weariness, the fever and the fret;  
Here, where men sit and hear each other groan,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
where palsy shakes a few sad last grey hairs,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;  
Where but to think is to be full of sorrow  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
and leaden-eyed despairs;  
Where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow.  

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 4 </div>

Away, away — for I will fly to thee  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
not charioted by Bacchus and his pards  
but on the viewless wings of Poesy,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
though the dull brain perplexes and retards;  
Already with thee! Tender is the night  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
and haply the Queen moon is on her throne  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cluster’d around by all her starry fays.  
But here there is no light,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
save what from heaven is with the breezes blown  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
through verd’rous glooms and winding mossy ways.  

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 5 </div>

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,  
but in embalmed darkness guess each sweet  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
wherewith the seasonable month endows:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the grass, the thicket, and the fruit tree wild,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
white hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fast-fading violets covered up in leaves,  
and mid-May’s eldest child,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
the coming musk rose, full of sweetest wine,  
the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.  

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 6 </div>

Darkling I listen, and for many a time  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have been half in love with easeful death,  
called him soft names in many a mused rhyme  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
to take into the air my quiet breath.  
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
to cease upon the midnight with no pain,  
while thou art pouring thus thy soul abroad  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
in such an ecstasy!  
Still would thou sing and I have ears in vain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
for thy high requiem, become a sod.

<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 7 </div>

Thou wast not born for death, immortal bird,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
no hungry generations tread thee down.  
The voice I hear this passing night was heard  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
in ancient days by Emperor and Clown,  
perhaps the selfsame song that found a path  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
through the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
she stood in tears amid the alien corn;  
The same that oftimes hath  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
charm’d magic casements opening on the foam  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
of perilous seas, in fairy lands forlorn.


<div style="font-size: 1.0em; padding-left: 12em; margin-bottom: -1em;"> 8 </div>

Forlorn! The very word is like a bell  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
to toll me back from thee unto myself.  
Adieu! The fancy cannot cheat so well  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
as she is fain’d to do, deceiving elf!  
Adieu! Adieu!  Thy plaintive anthem fades  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
past the near meadows, over the still stream,  
up the hillside and now ’tis buried deep  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the next valley’s glades.  
Was it a vision real or a waking dream?  
Fled is that music — do I wake or sleep?

The above arrangement is based on the [original manuscript][keats-orig] of 1819
by John Keats, and on the [manuscript of his brother][keats-brother] written shortly
thereafter.  There are numerous and interesting differences from the first print edition.
Even the title is a little different.
Enjoy!
