## Rimbaud

Here are some French poems written by Arthur Rimbaud,
along with my translations of them into English.

{: .table-indent}
| [Première soirée][soirée]          | | | *An invocation of his muse.*      |
| [Sensation][sensation]             | | | *Ambition and plans.*             |
| [Ophélie][ophélie]                 | | | *On inspiration, art, his place.* |
| [Le châtiment de Tartufe][tartufe] | | | *Saying his rosary.*              |
| [Venus Anadyomène][venus]          | | | *A take on a classic scene.*      |
| [Roman][roman]                     | | | *Romances!*                       |
| [Le Mal][mal]                      | | | *Really bad stuff.*               |
| [Rêvé pour l’hiver][hiver]         | | | *Intention to find.*              |
| [Le Dormeur du Val][dormeur]       | | | *A remembrance.*                  |
| [Au Cabaret-Vert][cabaret]         | | | *Stepping out.*                   |
| [La Maline][maline]                | | | *Maybe a malingerer.*             |
| [Le Buffet][buffet]                | | | *Doing his best Baudelaire.*      |
| [Ma Bohème][boheme]                | | | *And the beat goes on.*           |

All of the above are from his hand-written collection, given to a would-be publisher
when he was just fifteen years old, or maybe within days of his sixteenth birthday.
Which is pretty amazing.

And here are a couple from a short time later.

| [Larme][larme]                     | | | *Cry me a river.*                 |
| [Voyelles][voyelles]               | | | *Relations of relations.*         |

More to come.
