## Rimbaud

Here are some French poems written by Arthur Rimbaud,
along with my translations of them into English.

{: .table-indent}
| [Première soirée][soirée]    | | | *The invocation of his muse.*     |
| [Sensation][sensation]       | | | *Ambition and plans.*             |
| [Ophélie][ophélie]           | | | *On inspiration, art, his place.* |
| [Vénus anadyomène][venus]    | | | *A take on a classic scene.*      |
| [Le Dormeur du Val][cabaret] | | | *A remembrance.*                  |
| [Au Cabaret-Vert][cabaret]   | | | *Stepping out.*                   |

These are all from his hand-written collection, given to a would-be publisher
when he was just fifteen years old, or maybe within days of his sixteenth birthday.
Which is pretty amazing.
