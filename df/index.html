<div class="displaybox2">
<p>Todd,

<p>The first problem we would like to attack is the case when we have an
array of antennas randomly spread out in an area of about 1 to 3 acres.
In this case we want to use the array to find the azimuth and elevation
of incoming signals in the HF band.

<p>What we need is an algorithm that can quickly construct a correlation
table for the expected phase difference between the 3 to 10 different
antennas (they are mounted on vehicles, one per vehicle). This table
has to be usable from 1 to 30 MHz and for angles up to 85 degrees
elevation. All the vehicles have GPS so the relative positions are known
to within a couple of feet.  The receive equipment can measure the
phase difference fast between all the different antennas.

<p>With help of the correlation table the system can then look up the best
fit and output the result (which is of course a line of bearing as well
as the elevation of the incoming signal). If any vehicle moves, then a
new table has to be constructed.  So the algorithm must be able to take
in new vehicle locations, and continually calculate the new correlation
tables.

<p>Hi Lars,

<p>It never occurred to me that you could determine the direction,
including elevation, of an incoming wave by observing a set of phase
relationships among the received signals at several omnidirectional
antennas.  I've enjoyed thinking about this problem, which is a new one
for me.

<p>Here are some notes I took while initially thinking about the problem:

<div class="displaybox">

<p>
<img src="docs/azel-notes-1.svg" style="float:left; margin-right:1em; margin-left:1em;" alt="wavefront">
The wavefront travels distance \(d\) from B to A.  If the wavelength is \(\lambda\),
then the phase difference between A and B would be \(d/\lambda\) of a full wavelength,
or \((d/\lambda)\cdot 360\deg\).
</p>

<p>We measure azimuth, \(\alpha\), relative to the A/B axis with A as
  the origin.  We measure elevation, \(\epsilon\), also with origin A,
  as an angle of lift off the horizontal plane.  These local coordinates
  result in simple expressions.

<p>We assume the wave source is far enough away so that the wavefront can be
  considered flat, or planar, when it reaches us.  So the wavefront is a plane
  that moves perpendicularly to itself.  As a consequence, the az/el heading into
  the wavefront (perpendicularly) is exactly the same for all our receivers, including
  A and B.

<div style="clear:both">
</div>

<p>
<img src="docs/azel-notes-2.svg" style="float:left; margin-right:1em; margin-left:1em;" alt="wavefront zero elevation"/>
<b>Top View: </b>\(\epsilon=0\) and azimuth is \(\alpha\).  The quantity of interest is \(\ell\),
the distance the wavefront must travel between the time it encounters B, until it
encounters A.  Since \(\cos\alpha=\ell/d\) we have

\begin{equation}
\ell=d\cdot\cos\alpha
\end{equation}

And so the phase difference will be
\((\ell/\lambda)\cdot 360\deg\).
</p>

<div style="clear:both">
</div>

<p>
<img src="docs/azel-notes-3.svg" style="float:left; margin-right:1em; margin-left:1em; clear:left;" alt="wavefront zero azimuth"/>
<b>Side View:</b> now \(\alpha=0\), and we vary the elevation \(\epsilon\).  Similar to before,
\begin{equation}
\ell=d\cdot\cos\epsilon.
\end{equation}
</p>
<p>Note that the signals are in phase whenever \(\alpha=90\deg\), and also
  whenever \(\epsilon=90\deg\).  That's broadside and straight up, respectively.

<div style="clear:both">
</div>
<p>Now consider simultaneous azimuth and elevation.  What happens?  Well, in the
  first case, the quantity \(\ell\) turns out to be the distance \(d\) projected onto
  the axis of wave motion.  Same holds for the second case.  For simultaneous
  \(\alpha\) and \(\epsilon\), the projection of the distance \(d\) onto the direction
  of motion is simply \(d\cdot\cos\alpha\cos\epsilon\), and the expression

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\;\strut \ell = d\cdot\cos\alpha\cos\epsilon\;}
\end{equation}

<p>includes all of the previous results as special cases.  I believe
  this \(\ell\) gives us the phase relationship between A and B, by
  plugging it into \(\theta=(\ell/\lambda)\cdot 360\deg\).

<p>This simple relation allows us to easily determine the expected phase
  relationship between two antennas, given their positions, the wavelength,
  and the az/el heading to the incoming wave.
</div>

<p>As I understand the problem, the core issue is to compute the expected
phase relationship between two antennas, given that a signal comes from
a given direction.  Then you want to access a table of such data, for several
antennas, to find a direction given the measured phase relationships.

<p>I assume that the signal is sufficiently far away for the incoming
wavefront to be thought of as purely planar, with no significant
curvature.  The motion of the wavefront would then be perpendicular to
that plane.  This in turn implies that all the azimuth/elevation
headings will be the same, at each of our receivers.

<p>For a given pair of antennas A and B with known positions, let d be
the distance between them.  Let us express the heading to the
wavefront using azimuth and elevation from antenna A.  The azimuth
will be measured from this axis.  The elevation angle from the ground
plane.  Call these angles \(a\) and \(e\) respectively.

<p>In the notes, I worked out the expression for the quantity \(L\), which
is the distance the wavefront must travel between when it encounters
one antenna (B say), until it encounters the other antenna (A say).
Using these local coordinates, the expression for \(L\) is simply:

\begin{equation}
   L = d \cos(a) \cos(e)
\end{equation}

<p>And then the phase angle between A and B is just

\begin{equation}
   (L/\lambda) \cdot 360\deg
\end{equation}

<p>where lambda is the wavelength of the incoming signal.  (Omitting sign
considerations.)

<p>So it would be a simple matter to compute the table that you seek, as I understand it.
You can just take the position data and desired heading, convert to the above-sketched
local coordinates, do the simple calculation, and fill up your table.

<p>Of course I might have muffed the calculation.  If so, tell me!  (I don't mind having
my early mistakes caught so that I don't go too far with bad results.)


<hr />

<p>Instead of using these tables and then looking for a good fit to solve the problem,
it would be better if we could just take the phase measurements, wavelenth, and
position data, and then just compute the heading to the wavefront.  It might turn
out to be feasible, and I have just begun to think about this.

<p>When you do the problem in that order, I think you have to come to terms
with some issues that you get to ignore with the table approach.  One such
issue is that these randomly placed antennas will often be more than a wavelength
away from each other.  But you know where they are, so that should be okay.

<p>In general, I think what you'll end up with, at the core, is a set of equations
that look something like, for example

\begin{aligned}
   \cos(a) \cos(b) &= 0.345 \\
   \cos(a) \cos(b) &= 0.567
\end{aligned}

<p>where the two equations are using different local coordinates.  So you need
to unify them, and then determine  an \(a\) and \(b\) that make both true.  Unless
you're unlucky, there will be only one solution, and that is your azimuth
and elevation.  That would be your answer.  (In these equations, the phase
phase angle measurment and distance at one pair goes into the 0.345, and
a different pair goes into the 0.567.)

<p>This is just a sketch, and I need to think about it more.  But it
might be quite feasible to do it that way, and if we can, that would
be good, wouldn't it?

<p>So that's where I am.  Any feedback would be appreciated.

<p>Hi Lars,

<p>I worked out how to find an exact unique solution for (az, el) in a large
variety of cases, based on phase measurements between antennas.

<p>Recall from the previous email that a central relationship is

\begin{equation}
  L = d \cos(a) \cos(e),
\end{equation}

<p>where \(d\) is the distance between the antennas, \(a\) is azimuth, and \(e\) is
elevation.  \(L\) is the distance the wavefront travels between the time it encounters
the two antennas.  The expected phase measurement is then

\begin{equation}
  \theta = (L / \lambda) \cdot 360\deg,
\end{equation}

<p>where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the signal of interest.

<p>Now, if \(d\) is not too large, you can reverse the computation and compute
\(L\) based on the phase measurement.  I assume that you can measure phase
accurately, but only between -180 and 180.  You can measure \(d\) accurately,
and \(\theta\) accurately.  But you really cannot tell if one wave is, say, 1050 degrees
ahead of another.  The reading would say -30 degrees.

<p>So for now, let us assume that \(d\) is not too large, and in particular that
it is not more than half a wavelength of interest.  Then we can easily
determine \(L\) from a pure phase measurement.  The quantity \(L\) is really
what's of interest.

<p>So given 

\begin{equation}
  L = d \cos(a) \cos(e),
\end{equation}

<p>we get 

\begin{equation}
  \cos(a) \cos(e) = (L/d) =: k.
\end{equation}

<p>I think of \(k\) as the "shrinkage factor".  It is a number between zero and
one that indicates how much shorter than the \(d\) distance the wave actually
traveled.

<p>The above equation expresses the relationship between azimuth and elevation
that must hold in order to be consistent with the phase measurement that
was made.

<hr />

<p>Here's an example.  The distance between the antennas, \(d\), is 10 meters,
and the measured phase angle between the signals at those antennas
is 60 degrees, and the frequency is 10 MHz, or 30 meters.

<p>Since \(d\) is less than a half wavelength, we easily solve

\begin{equation}
  60 = (L / 30) \cdot 360,
\end{equation}

<p>getting \(L = 5\) meters.  In turn, the ratio \(L/d\) is \(5/10\), or \(0.5\).  So the set of
feasible azimuth elevation pairs is given by

\begin{equation}
  \cos(a) \cos(e) = 1/2.
\end{equation}

Here is a plot of the set of feasible pairs:

  <p><img src="docs/dfplot1.png" alt="feasible pairs"/>


<p>That general shape is always what such a solution set looks like.  Here is a set of
feasibilities for various shrinkage factors between 0 and 1:

  <p><img src="docs/dfplot2.png" alt="shrinkages"/>


<p>Now suppose we make another phase measurement between a different pair
of antennas, also not too far away.  Really, the only other
requirement is that the new axis not be parallel to the original
antenna axis.  One antenna can even be shared between the two pairs.

<p>We come up with an additional equation for the new antenna, and the azimuth/elevation
pairs are now constrained to be

\begin{equation}
  \cos(a) \cos(e) = k_2
\end{equation}

<p>where \(k_2\) is a potentially different shrinkage factor.  It is important to note,
however, that \(a\) and \(e\) are in coordinates local to the new axis.  We want
to express these azimuth/elevation pairs in the same coordinate system
as the first ones, and this is easy to do.  Recall that the actual direction
to the wavefront is the same as measured from any antenna, because the source
is far away.  Everybody reads the actual same elevation; it's only their
azimuths that are different in the local coordinate systems.  So all we have
to do to convert one coordinate system to another is to adjust the angle
of the azimuths by the angle between the antenna pairs.  Or alternately,
we can convert each to global az/el by adjusting each az according to the
axis deviation from north.

<p>So what happens is that we end up with two equations like this:

\begin{aligned}
  \cos(a) \cos(e) = k_1 \\
  \cos(a+\phi) \cos(e) = k_2
\end{aligned}

where \(\phi\) is a constant we know, and \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are each shrinkage
factors.  Each of those is a curve like we saw above (the second one
is shifted on the \(a\)-axis), and it fairly clearly intersects at a point
(or all the points).  It cannot intersect at two points, for example.
So that point is the only az/el pair that is consistent with our phase
measurements, and is the answer.

<hr />

<p>For example, suppose we have

\begin{equation}
  \cos(a) \cos(e) = 0.70 \\
  \cos(a - 30) \cos(e) = 0.53
\end{equation}

<p>Here they are plotted together:

  <p><img src="docs/dfplot3.png" alt="two feasibilities"/>

<p>We see graphically that they intersect at one point.

<hr />

<p>It is easy and efficient to actually compute that intersection point.  All
  you do is expand \(\cos(a+\phi)\) out according to the well-known
  <a href="/sumangle.html">relation</a>

\begin{equation}
  \cos(a+\phi) = \cos(a)\cos(\phi) - \sin(a)\sin(\phi)
\end{equation}

<p>noting that \(\cos(\phi)\) and \(\sin(\phi)\) are constants.  When you simplify
appropriately, you get

\begin{equation}
  \tan(a) = {\cos(\phi) - k_2/k_1 \over \sin(\phi)}
\end{equation}

So an appropriate \(\arctan\) of that is \(a\).  Given \(a\), it is easy to get
\(e\):

\begin{equation}
  \cos(e) = k_1 / \cos(a)
\end{equation}

so \(e\) is an appropriate \(\arccos\) of that.  (It turns out that the "principle value"
of \(\arctan\) and \(\arccos\) are the ones you want).

<p>These are really efficient calculations.  Just a few mults and divides, a few
cosines, an arccos, and an arctan.  Even slow hardware should be able to do 
many thousands of these per second.

<hr />

<p>So consider, the following simplified algorithm could work much of the time.
You have a field full of antennas, and a signal of interest.  Pick a pair of antennas
that are within a half wavelength, and measure the phase.  Then pick another
pair, and measure that phase. (Or just a third antenna not in line and also not
too far away).  Do the simple calculation, and get the answer.

<p>Interestingly, you can then use all your other antennas, even ones that are
"too far" from each other, to reinforce the answer you got.  You just
compute the expected phase between an <i>arbitrary</i> pair of antennas, and
verify that's what you measured.

<p>But notice that the core result needs only three, or maybe four antennas.

<hr />

<p>If you cannot find appropriately placed antennas (for the frequency of interest),
that means that either they are all too far from each other, or they are all lined
up in a row.  If they are all in a line, you lose&mdash;move them!

<p>If the problem is, say, that you're trying to measure for 30 MHz or 10 meters,
and you don't have any antennas within 5 meters of each other (or only one
such pair), then the problem is a little more involved.  But would this
happen in practice?

<p>If it does, I have ideas on how to proceed.  It would be pretty much
like the above, but the difference would relate to the \(\theta\)-to-\(L\)
calculation.  You don't get a unique value for \(L\), but you get several
possible values, the exact number of which depends on \(\lambda\) and \(d\).

<p>I think it's just a matter of looking at a fairly small number of discrete
cases and figuring out what is going on.  There might also be resolution issues that
are harder in this case.

<p>So given my assumptions and understanding of the problem, I think this line
is potentially winning.  Please let me know what you think.
