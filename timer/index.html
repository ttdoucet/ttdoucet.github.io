<div class="displaybox2">
<p>Hi Todd,

<p>From your resume, we are definitely interested in your skill set.
We would like you to answer the following test question to help us
further gauge your abilities:

<p>Assume that a small, portable device is being developed to measure the
speed of a bullet fired from a handgun.  An average bullet speed is 1000
mph, and the device should function in range of 300..3000 mph with the
measurement error not exceeding 5% throughout the whole range of speeds.
 
<p>The device's sensor consists of two coils (inductors) that report a
pulse when a bullet flies through them.  The pulses are already
amplified to LVTTL 3.3V levels.  As the software engineer, your
responsibility is to measure the time difference between the two pulses
and convert it into a numeric reading (in miles per hour.)
 
<p>The device uses an Atmel AVR MCU and displays the number on a 4-digit
LED display (multiplexed, common anode.)

<p>One obvious concern here is that the AVR MCU may be somewhat slow, and
the precision of the measurement may be unacceptable.  Please ascertain
the factors involved, and propose whatever it takes to ensure the
quality of the measurement.

<p>Please provide the source code (C) for the AVR microcontroller.  The
device, upon application of power, should display nothing.  After each
test shot the speed is displayed.

<p>Hi Christina,

<p>I was pleased by your question, and I took it as an excuse to
play around a little with a microcontroller to do some interval
measurements.

<p>I don't have an AVR, so I used the MSP430 I have.  The development
board consists of just a header board and a watch crystal (you can see it
in one of the pictures).  It is well-supported by open tools.  I used msp430gcc,
and I included the <a href="msp430code.html">C source</a> as an attachment.

<p>So I will describe the test setup I used, my thinking on the
precision issues, and the code that I wrote.

<hr />

<p>The problem is to measure the A/B time between the two pulses with
adequate accuracy and resolution.  I will assume that the distance
between the sensors is one meter.

<p>For the given speed range, the interval A/B is actually kind of long.
Three thousand mph sounds fast, but it works out to an A/B interval of
about 750 microseconds through the one-meter path.  Three quarters of a
millisecond.

<p>If you do the arithmetic at this upper end in terms of speed, it turns
out that you need to resolve approximately 35 microseconds in your time
measurement to meet the five percent velocity accuracy specification.
If you're counting clock ticks, the clock need only tick about 28 kHz or
so, minimum.  That's not very fast.

<p>I wanted to conveniently simulate the output of the
sensors, so I could run the code I developed for real.  I used
a Tektronix function generator to provide the pulses,
ran the pulses through a flip-flop arranged as a divide-by-2,
and took the two outputs from Q and Q-bar:

<p><img src="docs/flipschem.png" alt="flip-flop" style="border: 0"/>

<p>This gives me two separate pulses, out of phase, and I can
conveniently vary the time between them with the function generator knob.  The
time here is independent of duty cycle, and depends only on the
generator frequency.

<p>The setup is convenient, and also isolates (to some extent) my msp430
board from the function generator, so I am less likely to fry the former.

<p>Here are some pictures of the setup:

<p><img src="docs/ftngen.jpg" alt="function generator" style="border: 1px solid black"/>

<p><img  src="docs/flipflop2.jpg" alt="board wiring" style="border: 1px solid black"/>

<p>The MSP430 has a flexible clock system.  You can use a real crystal, up to
8 MHz I think.  But my board uses just a simple 32768 Hz watch
crystal.  This is not very limiting, because the MSP430 can clock off
of an on-chip high-frequency oscillator, which is disciplined to the watch
crystal through a software loop.  It also has abundant I/O, timers, and my
version has at least two built-in UARTS.  (It's cheap, too.)

<p>With this system I was able to do measurements of A/B time to an accuracy
of 5 microseconds or so.  I could probably do better, but this already
greatly exceeds the required accuracy.

<p>I run the onboard clock at 1.536 MHz, and use the timer_A capture facility
to timestamp the rising transitions on the input.  The timer ticks
themselves are sub-microsecond resolution.

<p>This clock speed is also convenient to run the on-chip UART
at 9600 baud.  This lets me conveniently communicate with the device over
a serial line.  I wrote a little command-line interface with which I can
specify various measurements to be made, and reported via the serial line.

<p>The microcontroller itself hangs off of the RS-232 port of a spare linux machine.
It draws its power from the serial port, via a circuit that I had already
built up from a previous project.  This circuit also does the necessary
level conversion from bipolar RS-232 to CMOS logic levels:

a linux machine:

<p>To recap, the setup goes like this: Function generator to flip flop to
get two outputs to measure, A/B.  Those A/B outputs go to the MSP430,
which hangs off the serial port via another circuit which powers it
and level shifts.  (The MSP430 also connects to the parallel port, and
that's how I download code to it.)

<p>The attached <a href="msp430code.html">C file</a>
is the complete source code,
except for a standard module which at
startup initializes the clock (in this case, to 1.536 MHz), as sketched above.

<p>The actual measurement code ended up being simple and flexible.  The measurements
are done by setting up a timer_A capture of an appropriate transition.  When
that happens, you get an interrupt and the timer value is stored in a register.
While you are waiting for such an event, you sleep.

<p>It would be trivial to add commands to compute duty cycle and other things
of interest.

<p>Here is a typescript from a recent session.  At the slow end:

<div class="displaybox">
<pre>AE3K interval timer for MSP430
    time -- measures and reports time elapsed between leading edges
    freq -- frequency, determined from measuring one cycle
    timeAB -- A/B interval timer, two different inputs
    bullet -- A/B interval, interpreted as velocity across 1 meter

Command> time
  period of A: 22615 ticks, 14723 microsecs

Command> freq
  frequency of A: 67 Hz

Command> timeAB
  A/B interval: 11309 ticks, 7362 microsecs

Command> bullet
  bullet speed: 303 mph

Command> 
</pre>
</div>

<p>Then I went to the function generator and cranked it up:

<div class="displaybox">
<pre>AE3K interval timer for MSP430
    time -- measures and reports time elapsed between leading edges
    freq -- frequency, determined from measuring one cycle
    timeAB -- A/B interval timer, two different inputs
    bullet -- A/B interval, interpreted as velocity across 1 meter

Command> time
  period of A: 1087 ticks, 707 microsecs

Command> freq

Command> timeAB
  A/B interval: 544 ticks, 354 microsecs

Command> bullet
  bullet speed: 6338 mph

Command> 
</pre>
</div>

<p>I have a very accurate frequency counter hooked up also, so I can actually
measure the accuracy.  The actual period is 708.39 microseconds.  The accuracy
here is well more than specified (and the corresponding bullet speed is also
twice the required maximum).
I will omit the details, but the system as it is clearly does quite a bit
better than required by the problem, throughout its range.

<p>Well, I enjoyed the little project.
From what I've been able to figure out looking at your web page, and from the
attitude that I perceive from your posts and your question, I am very
interested in discussing with you further how I might be able to work on your
projects.

<p>Sincerely,

<p>Todd Doucet
